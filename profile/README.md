# We're txts.

Txts is a faithful creation of the now-shutdown txti.es service which allows users to create markdown-based simple web pages.
Most of the world still does not have internet, but many websites from countries like the United States are big and
complicated. This makes it hard for people with slow internet to use these sites. It is even harder for those people to put
their own thoughts on the internet. With Txts, anyone can use any device to share their story.
